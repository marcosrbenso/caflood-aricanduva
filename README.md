# CAFLOOD Simulations â€“ Aricanduva Catchment

This repository contains CAFLOOD simulations for the Aricanduva Catchment, located in the SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region, Southeastern Brazil.

[CAFLOOD](https://cafloodpro.com/) is a diffusive wave flood model based on cellular automata, designed to simulate flood dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution.

The goal of this repository is to provide:

- Scripts for running CAFLOOD with different DEM sources and resolutions
- Input data processing workflows
- Parameter configurations for hydrodynamic simulations
- Outputs and visualizations of flood extents

# Getting Started
## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- R (â‰¥ 4.2.0)
- Libraries: sf, terra, raster, tidyverse, ggplot2, cafloodr, etc.

## Caflodr

cafloodr is an R package to automate the preprocessing and execution of CADDIES/CAFLOOD using R.
